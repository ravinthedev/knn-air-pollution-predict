<b>Research significance and objectives</b>

The research will further investigate the impact of global air emissions and pollution. A geo context-
derived data collected from stations by means of sensors provide a solution to the prediction of short
term air pollution information using a deep learning method. Main objectives will be;
Main objectives will be to find out accurate data sets around the globe considering, by investigating
key stations around the world that are collecting accurate air pollution data. Finding tools and
mechanisms used to collect such data and research on the methods of visualizing such data and
finally using an appropriate supervised machine learning algorithm to implement such prediction as
explained in the above section.
